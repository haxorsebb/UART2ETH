=== Technology Strategy

==== Core Technology Decisions

[options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
| Technology Area | Strategic Decision & Rationale

| *Architecture Pattern*
| Dual-core separation with interrupt/DMA - provides fault isolation while achieving hardware-driven performance

| *Programming Language*
| C with Native Pico SDK - leverages team expertise, provides full platform access, enables deterministic behavior

| *Memory Management*
| Static allocation only - enables industrial reliability through predictable behavior, no dynamic allocation risks

| *Inter-Core Communication*
| Cache-aligned ring buffers with mutexes - optimal performance with deterministic behavior

| *Ethernet Controller*
| ENC28J60 with software TCP/IP - "dumb" controller enables full code auditability and control
|===

==== Communication Architecture

*Ring Buffer Design:*

[source,c]
----
// Each entry = 1 cache line (64 bytes base + 1024 payload)
typedef struct {
    // Management Data (16 bytes)
    uint8_t  uart_channel;     // 0-3
    uint8_t  direction;        // TX/RX  
    uint8_t  status;           // FILLING/DRAINING/FULL/EMPTY
    uint8_t  payload_length;   // Actual data length
    uint32_t timestamp;        // Fill timestamp
    uint32_t sequence_id;      // For ordering/debugging
    uint32_t reserved;         // Future use/alignment
    
    // Payload Data (1024 bytes max)
    uint8_t  payload[1024];    // Fixed max size for worst case
} ring_entry_t;
----

*Memory Allocation Strategy:*

* Buffer Size: `(total_mem - static_vars) / sizeof(ring_entry_t) - 1` entries
* Cache Aligned: No core contention, optimal performance
* Overflow Policy: Drop oldest packets (deterministic, simple)

=== Decomposition Strategy

==== System Decomposition Approach

*Dual-core functional separation* - Each core specializes in distinct responsibilities with clean interfaces through shared memory ring buffers.

==== Major Components/Services

[options="header",cols="25,35,40"]
|===
| Component/Service | Responsibilities | Key Interfaces

| *Core 0 UART Manager*
| All 4 UART interfaces, interrupt/DMA handling, stream-to-packet conversion
| Hardware UARTs, Ring buffer producer

| *Core 1 Network Manager*
| TCP/IP stack, ENC28J60 control, packet-to-network conversion
| Ring buffer consumer, SPI to ENC28J60

| *Ring Buffer System*
| Inter-core communication, cache-aligned data transfer
| Shared memory + mutex interfaces

| *HTTP Management UI*
| Device configuration, diagnostics, OTA trigger
| HTTP server on Core 1

| *OTA Update System*
| Secure firmware updates, A/B partition management
| Secure boot, flash management
|===

==== Component Interaction Strategy

[plantuml, component-interaction, svg]

!include <C4/C4_Component>

title Component Interaction Strategy

Component(core0_uart, "Core 0\nUART Manager", "C/Interrupt", "4 UARTs → Packets")
Component(ring_buffer, "Ring Buffer\nSystem", "Shared Memory", "Cache-aligned transfer")
Component(core1_net, "Core 1\nNetwork Manager", "C/lwIP", "Packets → TCP")
Component(core1_http, "Core 1\nHTTP UI", "C/HTTP", "Management interface")
Component(core1_ota, "Core 1\nOTA Manager", "C/Secure", "Firmware updates")

Rel(core0_uart, ring_buffer, "produces", "Cache-aligned writes")
Rel(ring_buffer, core1_net, "consumes", "TCP transmission")
Rel(core1_http, core1_net, "shares Core 1", "Lower priority")
Rel(core1_ota, core1_net, "shares Core 1", "Secure updates")

note right of ring_buffer : Drop-oldest overflow\nDeterministic behavior
note right of core1_net : Priority: UART bridges > HTTP UI
----

*Interaction Principles:*

* Core 0 → Ring Buffer: UART streams converted to fixed-size packets, cache-aligned writes
* Ring Buffer → Core 1: Packet consumption for TCP transmission
* Overflow Policy: Drop oldest packets (deterministic, simple)
* Priority: UART processing takes priority over HTTP UI

=== Quality Achievement Strategy

==== Quality Goal Implementation

[options="header",cols="20,40,40"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Architectural Mechanisms | Validation Approach

| *Reliability*
| Core separation, static allocation, deterministic behavior, drop-oldest overflow
| Extended operation testing, fault injection, environmental testing

| *Compatibility*
| Protocol-agnostic packet handling, configurable UART parameters
| Testing with diverse industrial protocols, auto-negotiation validation

| *Performance*
| Interrupt/DMA driven I/O, cache-aligned buffers, hardware-optimized data paths
| Sustained 500kBaud testing, latency measurements, stress testing
|===

==== Cross-Cutting Concerns Strategy

[options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
| Cross-Cutting Concern | Implementation Strategy

| *Error Handling*
| Graceful degradation, fault isolation between cores, deterministic error responses

| *Memory Management*
| Static allocation only, pre-calculated buffer sizes, cache-aligned data structures

| *Security*
| Secure OTA updates, A/B partitioning, auditable code paths

| *Testing*
| Host-based testing with abstracted semaphores, hardware-in-the-loop validation
|===

=== Strategic Decisions and Trade-offs

==== Major Architectural Decisions

[options="header",cols="30,35,35"]
|===
| Decision | Rationale | Trade-offs

| *Dual-Core Separation*
| Fault isolation + performance, leverages RP2350 capabilities
| Increased complexity vs single-core simplicity

| *Fixed 1024-byte Packets*
| Deterministic behavior, handles worst-case scenarios
| 96% memory waste (avg 40 bytes vs 1024 max) accepted for simplicity

| *Drop-Oldest Overflow*
| Deterministic, reliable behavior under overload
| Data loss vs flow control complexity

| *Cache-Aligned Buffers*
| Optimal inter-core performance
| Memory overhead vs efficiency
|===

==== Key Trade-off: Fixed Packet Size Inefficiency

*The Challenge:*

* Realistic scenario: Max=1024 bytes, Average=40 bytes → 96% memory waste
* Risk: Significant resource inefficiency in typical use cases

*Mitigation Rationale:*

* Sub-5ms latency requirement limits buffering depth anyway (~2-3 packets maximum)
* Total waste limited: 4 UARTs × 3 packets × 1024 bytes = ~12KB (acceptable in 520KB system)
* Implementation simplicity enables reliable delivery

*Future Optimization Path:*

Protocol-aware multi-pool approach documented for later enhancement:

* Small Pool: 64-byte entries (for ≤40 byte packets)
* Medium Pool: 256-byte entries (for 41-200 byte packets)  
* Large Pool: 1024-byte entries (for 201-1024 byte packets)

==== Alternative Approaches Considered

[options="header",cols="25,50,25"]
|===
| Alternative | Why Not Selected | Key Insight

| *Single-Core Design*
| Cannot achieve 4-UART + network performance simultaneously
| Core separation essential for real-time requirements

| *Dynamic Memory Allocation*
| Conflicts with industrial reliability requirements
| Static allocation mandatory for predictable behavior

| *W5500 Ethernet Controller*
| Hardware TCP/IP stack not auditable, conflicts with compliance goals
| "Dumb" controller enables full code control
|===

=== Implementation Strategy

==== Development Approach

[options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
| Implementation Aspect | Strategy

| *Development Methodology*
| Test-driven development with host-based testing using abstracted semaphores

| *Testing Strategy*
| Host simulation with pthread/threads, then hardware validation

| *Risk Mitigation*
| Single UART + single TCP proof-of-concept first

| *Platform Abstraction*
| Abstract semaphores/mutexes for host testing: `platform_mutex_t`, `platform_semaphore_t`
|===
