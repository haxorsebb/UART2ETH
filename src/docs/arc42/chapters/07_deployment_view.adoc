title Firmware Deployment Pipeline

package "Development" {

  [Local Testing] as dev_test
}

package "QA Environment" {
  [Testbench Hardware] as qa_hw
  [Automated Tests] as qa_test
  [Release Approval] as qa_approve
}

package "Production" {
  [Cloud OTA Server] as ota_server
  [Field Devices] as field_devices
}

build --> qa_test : "Release Candidate"
qa_test --> qa_hw : "Hardware Validation"
qa_hw --> qa_approve : "Test Results"
qa_approve --> ota_server : "Approved Firmware"
ota_server --> field_devices : "HTTP Download"

note right of qa_approve : QA is sole gatekeeper\nfor production releases

title A/B Partition Boot Process

start

:Device powers on;
:RP2350 ROM bootloader reads partition table;

if (Active partition valid?) then (yes)
  :Boot from active partition;
  :Start watchdog timer;
  
  if (Firmware disables watchdog?) then (yes)
    :Mark partition as confirmed;
    :Normal operation;
    stop
  else (timeout)
    :Watchdog triggers rollback;
    :Switch to backup partition;
    :Boot from backup partition;
    stop
  endif
else (no)
  :Boot from backup partition;
  stop

=== Infrastructure Components

==== Build and Release Infrastructure

[cols="25,35,40"]
|===
| Component | Technology & Configuration | Purpose & Responsibilities

| CMake Build System
| Pico SDK integration, firmware signing

| Developer Hardware
| Individual RP2350 devices
| Local development and unit testing

| QA Testbench
| Single automated test fixture with RP2350
| Hardware-in-the-loop validation of release candidates

| Cloud OTA Server
| HTTP-based firmware distribution
| Serve approved firmware to field devices

| Key Management
| Secure cryptographic key storage
| Firmware signing keys, device authentication
|===

==== Security Architecture

[cols="30,70"]
|===
| Security Layer | Implementation

| Factory Key Embedding
| Cryptographic keys installed during initial manufacturing flash

| Firmware Signing
| All firmware builds cryptographically signed before distribution

| Secure Boot
| RP2350 ROM bootloader verifies firmware signatures before execution

| OTA Authentication
| Device authenticates with OTA server before firmware download

| Partition Verification
| Each partition validated before boot attempt
|===

=== Deployment Strategies

==== Firmware Update Process

[cols="25,35,40"]
|===
| Stage | Process | Validation & Control

| Development Build
| CMake compilation with embedded version tags
| Local developer testing on real hardware

| QA Validation
| Automated testbench execution
| Hardware-in-the-loop testing, manual approval gate

| Production Release
| QA promotes approved firmware to OTA server
| Single gatekeeper model, full traceability

| Field Deployment
| Device pulls firmware via HTTP when configured
| Manual reboot required, automatic rollback protection
|===

==== A/B Partition Management

@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent

title OTA Update Process

participant "Field Device" as device
participant "OTA Server" as ota
participant "ROM Bootloader" as rom
participant "Watchdog" as wd

device -> ota: Check for updates (HTTP)
ota -> device: New firmware available
device -> ota: Download firmware to inactive partition
device -> device: Verify firmware signature
device -> device: Mark new partition as active
device -> device: Manual reboot initiated
rom -> rom: Boot from newly active partition
rom -> wd: Start watchdog timer
device -> wd: Disable watchdog (success)
device -> device: Confirm partition as stable

note right of device : If watchdog times out,\nROM automatically boots\nfrom backup partition

|===

==== Rollback and Recovery Procedures

[cols="25,35,40"]
|===
| Scenario | Recovery Method | Implementation

| Boot Failure
| Automatic rollback via watchdog timeout
| RP2350 ROM bootloader switches to backup partition

| Corrupted Download
| Signature verification failure
| Device rejects invalid firmware, retains current version

| Network Issues
| Download retry mechanism
| Device continues with current firmware, retries later

| Total Firmware Corruption
| Device replacement
| No field recovery possible when both partitions corrupted
|===

==== Monitoring and Maintenance

[cols="30,70"]
|===
| Monitoring Aspect | Implementation

=== Configuration Management

==== OTA Server Configuration

The UART2ETH device supports flexible OTA server configuration:

* **Default Server**: Company-hosted cloud OTA server for standard deployments
* **Customer Servers**: Configurable OTA server URL via management interface
* **HTTP Protocol**: Simple HTTP-based firmware downloads (no HTTPS requirement)
* **Pull-based Updates**: Devices initiate update checks, no push capability
