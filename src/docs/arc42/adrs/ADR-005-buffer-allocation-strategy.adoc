= ADR-005: Ring Buffer Memory Allocation Strategy for UART2ETH

*Status:* ACCEPTED +
*Date:* 2025-07-27 +
*Deciders:* Architecture Team +
*Consulted:* Senior Developer +
*Informed:* Development Team

== Context

The UART2ETH system requires a ring buffer allocation strategy for inter-core communication between Core 0 (UART processing) and Core 1 (network processing). Based on our solution strategy (Chapter 4), we use cache-aligned ring buffers with fixed-size entries to enable deterministic, high-performance data transfer.

This ADR documents the critical decision between different buffer allocation approaches given our realistic packet size analysis:

* *Maximum payload size*: 1024 bytes (worst-case industrial protocol)
* *Minimum payload size*: 10 bytes (small sensor readings)
* *Average payload size*: 40 bytes (typical industrial data)

The buffer allocation strategy directly impacts:

* Memory efficiency and utilization
* System determinism and real-time behavior
* Implementation complexity and maintainability
* Development timeline and risk

This decision is architecturally significant because it affects the fundamental memory model of our dual-core architecture and determines whether we can achieve our non-negotiable requirements within the 520KB SRAM constraints of the RP2350.

== Decision Drivers

=== Primary Requirements

* *Industrial Reliability*: Must enable deterministic, predictable behavior for industrial applications
* *Static Memory Allocation*: All memory must be allocated at compile time (no dynamic allocation)
* *Sub-5ms Latency*: Latency requirement limits buffering depth, reducing total memory impact
* *Cache-Aligned Performance*: Inter-core communication must be optimized for dual-core RP2350
* *TDD Implementation*: Must be testable and maintainable using test-driven development

=== Constraints

* Limited to 520KB SRAM total on RP2350 platform
* Static allocation only (no malloc/free)
* Cache-line alignment required (64-byte boundaries)
* Maximum 2-3 packets buffered per UART due to latency constraints
* Must support worst-case 1024-byte payload scenarios

== Options Considered

=== Option A: Static Worst-Case Allocation (Baseline)

* *Approach*: Fixed ring buffer entries sized for maximum payload (1024 bytes + 16 bytes management = 1040 bytes per entry)
* *Memory Usage*: Each entry wastes 984 bytes when storing 40-byte average payloads (96% waste)
* *Determinism*: Completely predictable, compile-time allocation
* *Implementation Complexity*: Minimal - simple fixed-size array
* *Cache Alignment*: Straightforward alignment to cache boundaries
* *Testing*: Simple to test, no dynamic allocation edge cases

=== Option B: Protocol-Aware Multi-Pool

* *Approach*: Three separate buffer pools sized for different payload ranges
** Small Pool: 64-byte entries (for ≤40 byte packets)  
** Medium Pool: 256-byte entries (for 41-200 byte packets)
** Large Pool: 1024-byte entries (for 201-1024 byte packets)
* *Memory Usage*: Significantly more efficient (~20-30% waste vs 96%)
* *Determinism*: Still predictable, but requires pool management logic
* *Implementation Complexity*: Requires pool allocation logic, protocol size prediction
* *Cache Alignment*: More complex alignment across multiple pools
* *Testing*: Complex testing scenarios for pool exhaustion, allocation failures

=== Option C: Variable-Length with Fragmentation

* *Approach*: Variable-length entries with fragmentation and reassembly
* *Memory Usage*: Most efficient possible memory utilization
* *Determinism*: Unpredictable due to fragmentation and reassembly timing
* *Implementation Complexity*: High - fragmentation logic, reassembly buffers
* *Cache Alignment*: Complex alignment with variable sizes
* *Testing*: Very complex testing for fragmentation edge cases

== Decision

*Selected: Static Worst-Case Allocation*

Despite the significant memory inefficiency (96% waste in typical scenarios), static worst-case allocation scores highest in our weighted analysis due to our **reliability-first** architecture principles and aggressive **sub-5ms latency requirements**.

== Rationale

=== Why Static Allocation Over Multi-Pool (-10 score)

*Reliability Trumps Efficiency:*

* Industrial reliability is our non-negotiable #1 priority
* Static allocation provides **completely predictable behavior**
* No pool exhaustion scenarios or allocation failures
* Simpler testing with fewer edge cases

*Latency Constraint Mitigation:*

* Sub-5ms requirement limits buffer depth to ~2-3 packets maximum
* Total memory waste: 4 UARTs × 3 packets × 1024 bytes = ~12KB
* 12KB waste is **acceptable within 520KB total SRAM**

*Implementation Risk Reduction:*

* **TDD requirement** favors simpler, more testable implementation
* Aggressive delivery timeline cannot accommodate complex allocation logic
* Static allocation enables immediate development progress

=== Why Static Allocation Over Variable-Length (-23 score)

* Variable-length fails completely on **reliability and determinism**
* Fragmentation creates **unpredictable latency** - incompatible with sub-5ms requirement
* Testing complexity would significantly impact **TDD implementation**

=== Memory Efficiency Analysis

*Realistic Memory Impact:*

```
Worst-case buffer usage:
4 UARTs × 3 packets/UART × 1024 bytes/packet = 12KB total
Percentage of available SRAM: 12KB / 520KB = 2.3%

Total system memory budget impact: Acceptable
```

*Latency-Limited Buffering:*

* Sub-5ms latency inherently limits packet accumulation
* Small buffer depths make absolute memory waste manageable
* **Quality goal (latency) constraints enable architectural simplification**

== Consequences

=== Positive

* ✅ **Industrial Reliability**: Completely predictable memory behavior
* ✅ **Development Velocity**: Immediate implementation, no complex allocation logic
* ✅ **Testing Simplicity**: Straightforward test scenarios, high confidence
* ✅ **Cache Optimization**: Simple 64-byte alignment for optimal inter-core performance
* ✅ **Future Flexibility**: Clear optimization path documented for later enhancement

=== Negative

* ❌ **Memory Inefficiency**: 96% waste in typical scenarios (1024B allocated, 40B used)
* ❌ **Resource Utilization**: Suboptimal use of precious SRAM resource
* ❌ **Scalability Limitation**: Inefficiency grows with larger maximum packet sizes

=== Risks and Mitigation

*Primary Risk: Memory Inefficiency*

* **Probability**: High (96% waste is certain)
* **Impact**: Medium (limited by latency constraints to ~12KB total)
* **Mitigation**: Document multi-pool optimization path, monitor actual memory usage

*Secondary Risk: Future Scalability*

* **Probability**: Low (latency requirements unlikely to change)
* **Impact**: Medium (could require architectural changes)
* **Mitigation**: Protocol-aware multi-pool approach documented as known optimization

== Implementation Notes

=== Ring Buffer Entry Structure

[source,c]
----
// Each entry = 1024 bytes payload + 16 bytes management + padding to cache line
typedef struct {
    // Management Data (16 bytes)
    uint8_t  uart_channel;     // 0-3
    uint8_t  direction;        // TX/RX  
    uint8_t  status;           // FILLING/DRAINING/FULL/EMPTY
    uint8_t  payload_length;   // Actual data length (≤1024)
    uint32_t timestamp;        // Fill timestamp
    uint32_t sequence_id;      // For ordering/debugging
    uint32_t reserved;         // Future use/alignment
    
    // Payload Data (1024 bytes fixed)
    uint8_t  payload[1024];    // Fixed maximum size
} __attribute__((aligned(64))) ring_entry_t;  // Cache-aligned
----

=== Memory Allocation Strategy

* **Total Buffer Size**: `(available_memory - static_variables) / sizeof(ring_entry_t) - 1` entries
* **Per-UART Allocation**: Dynamic allocation from shared pool based on actual usage
* **Overflow Policy**: Drop oldest packets (deterministic behavior)

== Future Optimization Path

When memory efficiency becomes critical (e.g., adding features that require more SRAM), implement **Protocol-Aware Multi-Pool** allocation:

=== Multi-Pool Implementation Strategy

[source,c]
----
// Future optimization - three separate pools
typedef struct {
    ring_entry_t small_pool[SMALL_POOL_SIZE];   // 64-byte entries
    ring_entry_t medium_pool[MEDIUM_POOL_SIZE]; // 256-byte entries  
    ring_entry_t large_pool[LARGE_POOL_SIZE];   // 1024-byte entries
    
    // Pool allocation logic
    pool_allocator_t allocator;
} multi_pool_ring_buffer_t;
----

=== Protocol Size Prediction

* **Runtime Analysis**: Monitor actual packet sizes during operation
* **Protocol Configuration**: Per-UART protocol profiles specifying expected size ranges
* **Adaptive Allocation**: Adjust pool usage based on observed patterns

=== Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Implement size monitoring in current static allocation
2. **Phase 2**: Develop pool allocation logic with same interfaces  
3. **Phase 3**: A/B test multi-pool vs static allocation
4. **Phase 4**: Switch to multi-pool if memory pressure requires it

== Alternative Approaches Considered

=== Per-UART Configurable Sizing

* **Concept**: Compile-time configuration of maximum packet size per UART
* **Rejection Reason**: Adds complexity without addressing core efficiency problem
* **Example**: UART0=64B, UART1=128B, UART2=1024B, UART3=256B

=== Hybrid Static + Overflow

* **Concept**: Small static buffers + large overflow buffer for rare large packets
* **Rejection Reason**: Violates deterministic behavior requirement
* **Risk**: Overflow scenarios create unpredictable timing

== Follow-up Actions

1. **Memory Monitoring**: Implement runtime memory usage tracking in debug builds
2. **Size Analysis**: Log actual packet sizes during development and testing
3. **Pool Design**: Document detailed multi-pool implementation specifications
4. **Performance Validation**: Benchmark static allocation performance characteristics
5. **Future Review**: Schedule memory efficiency review after core implementation
