== Decision

*Selected: Raspberry Pi RP2350*

The RP2350 scores significantly higher (+30 vs +22) in the weighted PUGH analysis, primarily due to:

. *Superior UART Flexibility*: PIO state machines provide unmatched capability for implementing custom UART protocols
. *A/B Update Architecture*: External flash design enables reliable dual-partition firmware updates
. *Security Architecture*: Hardware SHA-256 and TrustZone directly address secure OTA requirements
. *Cost Advantage*: 37% lower total system cost while providing better capabilities
. *Real-time Determinism*: PIO subsystem + dual-core architecture enables predictable performance

== Rationale

=== Why RP2350 Over ATMega328P

* *Performance Gap*: 328P cannot handle 4 concurrent UARTs + TCP processing
* *Memory Limitation*: 2KB SRAM insufficient for networking stack and buffering
* *A/B Update Impossibility*: 32KB flash insufficient for dual firmware images (need ~64KB minimum)
* *Security Gap*: No hardware security features compromise OTA update integrity
* *Future Flexibility*: PIO enables protocol adaptations without hardware changes

=== Why RP2350 Over ESP32

* *Industrial Focus*: No unnecessary WiFi attack surface in industrial environments
* *Cost Efficiency*: Lower total system cost for same networking capability
* *Architectural Fit*: PIO subsystem specifically designed for custom I/O protocols
* *Security Model*: TrustZone provides more comprehensive security architecture
* *UART Flexibility*: Superior support for multiple custom UART implementations

*Industrial Reliability Trade-off*: While ESP32 has solid 8+ years of industrial deployment vs RP2350's zero field history, neither matches ATMega328P's decades of proven reliability.

*Development Ecosystem Trade-off*: ATMega328P's Arduino ecosystem is unmatched in accessibility, tutorials, and community support. Both RP2350 and ESP32 have smaller ecosystems despite good documentation.

Despite these disadvantages, the RP2350's technical advantages outweigh these risks for our specific application requirements.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* ✅ *Technical Capability*: Meets all performance and functionality requirements
* ✅ *Cost Optimization*: Lowest total system cost among capable options
* ✅ *Security Compliance*: Hardware support for all security requirements
* ✅ *Development Efficiency*: Excellent documentation and tooling ecosystem
* ✅ *Future Flexibility*: PIO enables protocol extensions without redesign

=== Negative

* ⚠️ *External Dependency*: Requires ENC28J60 Ethernet controller
* ⚠️ *Industrial Deployment Risk*: Zero field deployment history in industrial environments (released August 2024)
* ⚠️ *Platform Maturity*: Less proven than ATMega328P's decades of industrial use
* ⚠️ *Development Ecosystem*: Smaller community and fewer resources compared to Arduino's massive ecosystem
* ⚠️ *Custom Development*: PIO programming requires specialized knowledge

=== Risks and Mitigation

* *Supply Chain Risk*: Multiple suppliers available, stockpile strategy for critical components
* *ENC28J60 Dependency*: Well-established component with multiple sources and alternatives
* *Industrial Reliability Risk*: RP2350 has zero industrial field deployment history; mitigate with extensive environmental testing and validation program
* *Development Complexity*: Comprehensive documentation and examples available

== Implementation Notes

* *ENC28J60 Ethernet Controller*: Hardware TCP/IP stack, SPI interface
* *Crystal/Oscillator*: For precise timing if required by application
* *Power Supply*: 3.3V regulation and filtering
* *Protection*: ESD protection for industrial environments

=== Development Approach

* *Phase 1*: Basic RP2350 + ENC28J60 integration with single UART
