*Status:* PROPOSED +
*Date:* 2025-07-26 +
*Deciders:* Architecture Team +
*Consulted:* Senior Developer +
*Informed:* Development Team

== Context

The UART2ETH system requires selecting a programming language for firmware development on the RP2350 microcontroller. This decision directly impacts development velocity, system reliability, maintainability, and the ability to meet project delivery timelines.

Based on hardware platform decisions (ADR-001: RP2350 selection, ADR-002: ENC28J60 selection), we need a programming language that can:

* Deliver industrial-grade reliability for 4 concurrent UART-to-TCP bridges
* Support real-time performance requirements (500 kbps per port, sub-5ms latency)
* Enable rapid development with existing team expertise
* Operate efficiently in severely memory-constrained environment (520KB SRAM, static allocation)
* Provide adequate safety guarantees for industrial deployment
* Meet aggressive project delivery timeline ("deliver yesterday")
* Must operate reliably in industrial environments (-40¬∞C to +85¬∞C) üòâ

The programming language selection fundamentally determines development productivity, code maintainability, and the feasibility of meeting project deadlines with current team capabilities.

== Decision Drivers

* *Debugging Capabilities*: Mature debugging tools for embedded development

=== Constraints

* Aggressive delivery timeline with no room for learning curve delays
* Small project scope where complexity management is achievable
* Static memory allocation model (no dynamic allocation)
* Team expertise concentrated in C/C++ embedded development
* Must operate reliably in industrial environments (-40¬∞C to +85¬∞C) üòâ

* *Ecosystem*: Emerging ecosystem with excellent RP2350 day-one support (rp235x-hal)
* *Team Expertise*: No existing knowledge, 6-12 month learning curve to proficiency
* *Development Velocity*: Significant initial productivity loss during team transition
* *Memory Model*: Memory safety guarantees less relevant in static allocation environment
* *Tooling*: Improving but less mature debugging tools (probe-rs vs GDB)
* *Hardware Support*: Good RP2350 support, limited ENC28J60 ecosystem

== Decision

*Selected: C Programming Language*

The C programming language provides the optimal balance of development velocity, team productivity, and technical capability for the UART2ETH project, scoring significantly higher in our weighted analysis.

== Rationale

=== Why C Over Rust

* *Immediate Productivity*: Team can begin productive development immediately without learning curve delays

* *Time-Critical Delivery*: Project timeline ("deliver yesterday") cannot accommodate 6-12 month Rust learning curve

* *Static Memory Context*: Rust's primary advantages (memory safety) are significantly diminished in our static allocation environment where:
  - No dynamic allocation eliminates use-after-free, double-free, memory leaks
  - Fixed buffer sizes and lifetimes reduce dangling pointer risks
  - Predictable memory layout simplifies debugging and validation

* *Team Expertise Leverage*: Deep microcontroller C experience translates to immediate high-quality code

* *Ecosystem Maturity*: Comprehensive vendor support, mature tooling, extensive industrial deployment history

* *Manageable Complexity*: Small project scope where C complexity is controllable through:
  - Disciplined coding practices (MISRA-C guidelines)
  - Comprehensive unit and integration testing
  - Code reviews focused on memory safety patterns
  - Static analysis tools

=== Memory Safety Strategy in C

* *Static Allocation*: All memory allocated at compile time, eliminating dynamic memory risks
* *Defensive Programming*: Bounds checking, input validation, error handling
* *Testing Strategy*: 100% code coverage, stress testing, hardware-in-the-loop validation
* *Code Standards*: MISRA-C compliance for industrial safety
* *Review Process*: Mandatory security-focused code reviews

=== Rust Advantages Acknowledged But Outweighed

* *Compile-time Memory Safety*: Valuable but less critical in static allocation environment
* *Modern Type System*: Benefits outweighed by learning curve and timeline pressure
* *Future-proofing*: Theoretical benefit cannot justify immediate delivery risk
