*Status:* PROPOSED +
*Date:* 2025-07-26 +
*Deciders:* Architecture Team +
*Consulted:* Senior Developer +
*Informed:* Development Team

## Context

The UART2ETH system requires an Ethernet controller that interfaces with the RP2350 microcontroller via SPI to provide reliable TCP/IP connectivity. This component is critical for the core networking functionality of our product.

Based on our microcontroller selection (ADR-001), we need to determine the most appropriate Ethernet controller solution that can:

* Support 100 Mbps Ethernet connectivity
* Interface with the RP2350 via SPI
* Handle the networking requirements of up to 4 concurrent UART-to-TCP bridges
* Operate reliably in industrial environments (-40°C to +85°C)
* Maintain low latency while supporting our 500 kbps per port requirement
* Simplify firmware development with minimal microcontroller overhead
* Meet our cost target for volume production
* Does not contain firmware on its own
* Comes from a 'western' supplier

The Ethernet controller selection impacts system performance, reliability, development complexity, and overall BOM cost.

## Decision

*Selected: ENC28J60*

While the W5500 is technically superior in every aspect and more easy to integrate, the ENC28J60 is a *dumb* device, which is, given to goal of maximum control, auditable software and upgradeable software, exactly what we want. And additionally it is from a 'western' manufacturer.

## Rationale

### Why ENC28J60 Over W5500

* *Dumb*: The ENC28J60 has no complex firmware.

* *Auditable Sourcecode*: The main network code is in the microcontrollers firmware, which we have total control over. This allows us to show *all* relevant code for audits.

* *Western Manufacturer*: Because of supply chain considerations we want this project to contain only 'western' manufacturers. While technically South Korea is a western ally, it is still in the east.


### Trade-offs Accepted

* *Cost Premium*: The $0.50 additional cost per unit for the W5500 is justified by the significant performance advantages, reduced development complexity, and system resource savings.

* *Lower Performance*: The W5500 is superior in all aspects of performance. But the ENC28J60 is *good enough* to match the performance criteria.

## Consequences

### Positive

* ✅ *Minimal Performance*: ENC28J60 provides enough network bandwidth for current needs
* ✅ *Physical Size*: 28SSOP package requires slightly less PCB space
* ✅ *Industrial Reliability*: Full industrial temperature range support
* ✅ *External Dependency*: Reliance on a more generic controller with more alternatives

### Negative

* ⚠️ *Resource Spending*: More microcontroller overhead diminishes resources for other features
* ⚠️ *Slightly Higher Cost*: $0.50 cost premium per unit compared to W5500
* ⚠️ *More Complex Development*: Software TCP/IP stack incraeses code complexity and development time

### Risks and Mitigation

* *Supply Chain Risk*: Establish multiple supplier relationships, consider inventory strategy
* *Single-Source Component*: Document adaptation path to alternative controllers if necessary
* *Integration Complexity*: Thoroughly validate the ENC28J60-RP2350 integration early in development

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Optimization

* Use burst SPI mode for maximum throughput (up to 25 MHz)
* Optimize buffer management for latency-sensitive applications)

## Follow-up Actions

1. *Procurement*: Source ENC28J60 components from multiple suppliers to validate availability
2. *Prototyping*: Develop initial integration test for RP2350 + ENC28J60 communication
3. *Performance Testing*: Benchmark SPI communication speeds and TCP throughput
5. *Industrial Validation*: Test operation across full temperature range
