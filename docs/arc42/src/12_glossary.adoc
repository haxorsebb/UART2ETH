|Term |Definition

|A/B Updates
|Dual partition firmware update strategy that maintains two separate flash memory partitions (A and B) containing different firmware versions. During updates, the new firmware is written to the inactive partition while the system continues running from the active partition. If the new firmware fails or becomes corrupted, the system can automatically rollback to the previous working version, ensuring system reliability and preventing brick situations in remote deployments.

|Arduino
|Open-source electronics platform consisting of both hardware boards (microcontroller development boards) and software (integrated development environment). Arduino provides a simplified programming framework with pre-built libraries and functions that abstract complex microcontroller operations, making embedded programming accessible to beginners while remaining powerful enough for professional applications. The Arduino ecosystem includes thousands of community-contributed libraries and shields (expansion boards).

|CI/CD
|Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - modern software development methodology that automates the building, testing, and deployment pipeline. CI automatically builds and tests code changes when developers commit to version control, catching integration issues early. CD extends this by automatically deploying tested code to production environments, reducing manual errors and enabling rapid, reliable software releases.

|Client System
|In Gateway Mode, the networked device or application that connects to UART2ETH via TCP sockets to communicate with legacy serial equipment. Client systems can be computers, servers, mobile devices, or other networked equipment that need to access serial devices remotely over Ethernet networks. Examples include monitoring software, configuration tools, or remote control applications.

|CMake
|Cross-platform, open-source build system generator that creates native build files (Makefiles, Visual Studio projects, Xcode projects) from platform-independent configuration files. CMake manages complex build dependencies, compiler flags, and linking requirements across different operating systems and compilers, simplifying the build process for C/C++ projects and enabling consistent builds across development teams.

|ENC28J60
|Low-cost Ethernet controller chip from Microchip Technology that provides 10Base-T Ethernet connectivity via SPI interface. This single-chip solution includes MAC (Media Access Control) and PHY (Physical Layer) functions, making it popular for adding basic Ethernet capabilities to microcontroller projects. It requires external TCP/IP stack implementation and offers a cost-effective alternative to more integrated solutions.

|Full Bridge Mode
|UART2ETH operating mode that creates a transparent network bridge between two serial devices located at different physical locations. Both devices communicate through their UART interfaces as if they were directly connected with a serial cable, but the connection is actually routed through TCP/IP networks. This mode enables legacy serial equipment to communicate across long distances, through existing network infrastructure, without requiring protocol modifications.

|Gateway Mode
|UART2ETH operating mode that adds network connectivity to existing serial-only equipment without modifying the original device. The UART2ETH device acts as a protocol gateway, translating between the legacy device's serial communication and modern TCP/IP networking. This allows multiple network clients to simultaneously access serial equipment, enabling remote monitoring, configuration, and control of industrial equipment, embedded systems, or test instruments.

|Host System
|The serial equipment or device connected to UART2ETH's physical UART interface. In Gateway Mode, this is typically legacy industrial equipment, embedded systems, or test instruments that only support serial communication. In Full Bridge Mode, both endpoints are considered Host Systems. Host Systems are unaware of the network translation and continue using their native serial protocols.

|HW UART
|Hardware Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter - dedicated silicon circuitry within microcontrollers that handles serial communication at the hardware level. HW UARTs provide precise timing, automatic start/stop bit handling, parity checking, and interrupt generation without CPU intervention. This contrasts with software-based UART implementations that consume CPU cycles and may have timing limitations, especially at higher baud rates.

|Misra-c
|Motor Industry Software Reliability Association C - comprehensive coding standard that defines strict guidelines for writing safety-critical C code. MISRA-C rules cover language subset restrictions, coding practices, and documentation requirements designed to eliminate common programming errors, undefined behaviors, and implementation-defined constructs. Originally developed for automotive software, it's now widely used in aerospace, medical devices, and industrial control systems.

|OTA (Over-The-Air)
|Remote firmware update mechanism that allows devices to receive and install new firmware through their existing communication channels (WiFi, Ethernet, cellular) without requiring physical access. OTA updates enable field devices to receive bug fixes, security patches, and feature updates remotely, reducing maintenance costs and enabling rapid deployment of improvements across device fleets. Critical for IoT devices in remote or inaccessible locations.

|PIO
|Programmable Input/Output - specialized hardware feature of the Raspberry Pi RP2350 microcontroller that provides highly flexible, real-time I/O processing independent of the main CPU cores. PIO consists of state machines that can execute custom assembly-like programs to handle precise timing requirements for protocols like WS2812 LEDs, custom serial formats, or parallel interfaces. Each PIO block can run multiple state machines simultaneously, enabling complex I/O operations without CPU intervention.

|PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
|Industrial computer designed for automation of manufacturing processes, machinery control, and industrial monitoring systems. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial environments and provide real-time control with deterministic response times. They typically use ladder logic programming and offer extensive I/O capabilities for sensors, actuators, and communication networks. Common in factory automation, process control, and building management systems.

|platformio
|Modern, open-source ecosystem for embedded and IoT development that provides unified tooling across multiple microcontroller platforms, frameworks, and boards. PlatformIO includes cross-platform IDE, library manager, unit testing framework, remote debugging capabilities, and continuous integration support. It abstracts away toolchain complexity while supporting hundreds of development boards and frameworks including Arduino, ESP-IDF, STM32, and many others.

|Protocol Filter
|Pluggable software component within UART2ETH that intelligently processes and optimizes serial data streams before TCP transmission. Protocol filters can implement packet framing, data compression, error correction, or protocol-specific optimizations to reduce network bandwidth, improve latency, or enhance reliability. Examples include buffering strategies for bulk data transfers, real-time filtering for control systems, or custom packet structures for specific industrial protocols.

|RPI RP2350
|Second-generation microcontroller chip from Raspberry Pi Foundation featuring dual ARM Cortex-M33 cores running up to 150MHz, 520KB SRAM, advanced security features, and flexible I/O capabilities including PIO state machines. The RP2350 provides enhanced performance and security compared to the original RP2040, making it suitable for industrial applications requiring real-time processing, secure communications, and complex I/O handling.

|SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
|Industrial control system architecture used for monitoring and controlling large-scale processes across multiple locations. SCADA systems collect data from remote sensors and equipment, provide centralized monitoring through human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and enable operators to control distributed processes. Common in utilities (power grids, water treatment), manufacturing, and transportation systems where real-time monitoring and control of geographically dispersed equipment is essential.

|SPI Ethernet Controller
|Ethernet controller chip that communicates with microcontrollers through the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol rather than parallel buses. These controllers handle the complex Ethernet physical layer operations (signal encoding, collision detection, carrier sensing) while presenting a simple SPI interface to the host microcontroller. This approach reduces pin count requirements and simplifies PCB design while providing reliable network connectivity for embedded systems.

|SPI TCP/IP Controller
|Integrated circuit that implements the complete TCP/IP protocol stack in hardware and communicates with host microcontrollers via SPI interface. These chips handle all network protocol processing (IP, TCP, UDP, ARP, DHCP) independently, presenting socket-based APIs through SPI commands. This offloads complex network processing from the main microcontroller, simplifying firmware development and improving real-time performance for applications requiring both networking and real-time control.

|TCP Socket
|Network communication endpoint that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data streams between applications over IP networks. TCP sockets establish connections, handle flow control, retransmission of lost packets, and ensure data integrity through checksums and acknowledgments. Unlike UDP, TCP guarantees that data arrives in the correct order and without errors, making it essential for applications requiring reliable data transmission such as file transfers, web browsing, and industrial control protocols.

|UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
|Serial communication protocol and hardware interface that transmits data character by character without requiring a shared clock signal between communicating devices. UART uses start and stop bits to frame each character, with configurable data bits (5-9), parity (none, even, odd), and stop bits (1, 1.5, 2). This asynchronous approach makes UART simple to implement and widely compatible, leading to its extensive use in embedded systems, industrial equipment, and debugging interfaces.

|UART2ETH
|Complete hardware and firmware solution that bridges between UART serial interfaces and TCP/IP Ethernet networks, supporting up to 4 simultaneous UART connections. The system provides bidirectional data translation, protocol filtering, secure OTA updates, and flexible operating modes (Gateway and Full Bridge) to enable legacy serial equipment integration with modern networks. Built on the RPI RP2350 platform with support for various Ethernet controller options.

|W5500
|Fully integrated Ethernet controller from WIZnet that combines 10/100 Ethernet MAC, PHY, and a complete TCP/IP protocol stack in a single chip. The W5500 communicates with host microcontrollers via SPI and provides hardware-accelerated socket operations, automatic packet processing, and wake-on-LAN capabilities. Its integrated approach simplifies network integration for embedded systems by handling all low-level networking operations transparently, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than network protocols.
