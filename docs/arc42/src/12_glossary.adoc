.Contents
The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in multi-language teams.

.Motivation
You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

* have an identical understanding of these terms
* do not use synonyms and homonyms


.Form

A table with columns <Term> and <Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/[Glossary] in the arc42 documentation.

|Term |Definition

|A/B Updates
|Firmware update mechanism that maintains two separate firmware partitions, allowing safe rollback to previous version if new firmware fails

|Arduino
|Open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software, providing development framework and IDE for microcontroller programming

|CI/CD
|Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - automated software development practices for building, testing, and deploying code changes

|Client System
|In Gateway Mode, the system connected to the network side of UART2ETH that communicates via TCP sockets

|CMake
|Cross-platform build system generator that manages the build process in an operating system and compiler independent manner

|ENC28J60
|Microchip Ethernet controller chip with SPI interface, providing 10Base-T Ethernet connectivity for microcontrollers

|Full Bridge Mode
|Operating mode where UART2ETH provides transparent UART-over-TCP connectivity, allowing two Host Systems with UART interfaces to communicate over network as if directly connected

|Gateway Mode
|Operating mode where UART2ETH adds networking capabilities to existing products by bridging between a Host System's UART interface and Client Systems on the network

|Host System
|System connected to the UART side of UART2ETH. In Gateway Mode, this is the legacy equipment being networked. In Full Bridge Mode, both connected systems are Host Systems

|HW UART
|Hardware Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter - dedicated silicon implementation of UART communication interface in microcontrollers

|Misra-c
|Motor Industry Software Reliability Association C - coding standard defining guidelines for using C programming language in safety-critical systems

|OTA (Over-The-Air)
|Firmware update mechanism allowing remote updates without physical access to the device

|PIO
|Platform IO - cross-platform IDE and ecosystem for embedded development supporting multiple microcontroller platforms and frameworks

|PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
|Industrial control system used in manufacturing and automation applications

|platformio
|Open-source ecosystem for IoT development with cross-platform IDE, unified debugger, and remote unit testing

|Protocol Filter
|Pluggable software component that processes and optimizes serial data streams for efficient TCP transmission

|RPI RP2350
|Raspberry Pi microcontroller chip serving as the main processing unit for UART2ETH hardware

|SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
|Industrial control system architecture for monitoring and controlling industrial processes

|SPI Ethernet Controller
|Serial Peripheral Interface based Ethernet controller that provides network connectivity through SPI communication protocol

|SPI TCP/IP Controller
|Integrated circuit that handles TCP/IP protocol stack via SPI interface, offloading network processing from main microcontroller

|TCP Socket
|Network communication endpoint using Transmission Control Protocol for reliable data transmission

|UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
|Serial communication protocol commonly used in embedded systems and industrial equipment

|UART2ETH
|The complete hardware and firmware solution for bridging UART interfaces to TCP sockets, supporting up to 4 UART ports

|W5500
|WIZnet Ethernet controller chip with integrated TCP/IP stack and SPI interface, providing full-duplex 10/100 Ethernet connectivity
