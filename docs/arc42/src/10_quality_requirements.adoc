.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Requirements Summary

The quality scenarios establish measurable success criteria that guide both architectural decisions and validation approaches. Critical scenarios represent non-negotiable requirements where system failure would render the product unsuitable for industrial deployment. High priority scenarios significantly impact user satisfaction and market adoption. Lower priority scenarios enhance user experience and reduce operational costs.

These scenarios serve as the foundation for:
- Architecture decision evaluation criteria
- Test case development and acceptance criteria
- Performance benchmarking and validation
- Stakeholder communication about quality expectations
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning

The concrete, measurable nature of these scenarios enables objective validation and provides clear guidance for architectural trade-offs throughout the development process.
