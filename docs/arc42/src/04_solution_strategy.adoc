==== Strategic Decision: RP2350 Selection

**Decision**: We selected the **Raspberry Pi RP2350** as the microcontroller platform for UART2ETH.

**Primary Rationale:**

. **UART Scalability**: The RP2350's unique Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem provides unmatched flexibility for implementing up to 4 dedicated UART interfaces with custom timing and protocol requirements. The 12 PIO state machines can be configured as additional UARTs beyond the 2 hardware UARTs.

. **Security Requirements**: Hardware-accelerated SHA-256 and Arm TrustZone security architecture directly address our secure OTA update requirements. The ATMega328P lacks hardware security features entirely.

. **Performance Architecture**: Dual-core Cortex-M33 @ 150MHz provides sufficient processing power for concurrent UART handling and TCP protocol processing while maintaining deterministic real-time performance.

. **Cost Effectiveness**: At ~$3.00 total system cost (including W5500 Ethernet PHY), the RP2350 solution is the most cost-effective option for our industrial networking requirements.

. **Industrial Reliability**: Operating temperature range (-40°C to +85°C) and robust electrical characteristics meet industrial deployment requirements.

**Alternative Analysis:**

*ATMega328P Rejection*:
- Insufficient processing power for 4 concurrent UARTs + TCP processing
- Limited memory (2KB SRAM) inadequate for networking stack and packet buffering  
- Single UART hardware severely limits our core functionality
- No hardware security features compromise OTA update integrity

*ESP32 Rejection*:
- Built-in WiFi creates unwanted security attack surface for industrial environments
- Lacks native Ethernet support, requiring same external PHY as RP2350
- Higher power consumption unsuitable for some industrial deployments
- While processing power is excellent, the integrated wireless capabilities are unnecessary overhead

**Risk Mitigation**:
- *External Ethernet Dependency*: W5500 PHY chip is mature, well-documented, and widely deployed in industrial applications
- *Newer Platform Risk*: RP2350 builds on proven RP2040 architecture with extensive documentation and community support
