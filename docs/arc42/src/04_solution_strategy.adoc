.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.

|===

=== Architectural Drivers

==== Business Drivers (Priority Order)

* *Regulatory Compliance* - Western-only components, anticipating new regulations for updateable/auditable firmware
* *Market Gap* - Address discontinued commercial solutions, provide open source alternative to expensive/black-box products
* *Industrial Deployment* - Must operate reliably in harsh industrial environments
* *ROI* - First-year return on investment (afterthought, minimal architectural influence)

==== Technical Drivers (Priority Order)

* *4-UART Requirement* - Multiple concurrent serial bridges, each must operate independently
* *Static Memory Model* - No dynamic allocation, all memory allocated at compile time for predictable behavior
* *RP2350 Platform* - Dual-core ARM, PIO capabilities, security features enable advanced functionality

==== Organizational Drivers (Priority Order)

* *TDD + C Expertise* - Mandatory test-driven development, deep embedded C knowledge in team
* *Arc42 Documentation* - Standardized architecture documentation approach
* *Open Source GPL* - Complete transparency (minimal architectural influence)

=== Architecture Significant Requirements (ASRs)

==== Non-Negotiable (System Fails Without These)

* *Industrial Reliability* - Must not fail during normal operation
* *Static Resource Allocation* - Enables reliability through predictability
* *500kBaud Sustained Rate* - Crucial performance baseline
* *Secure OTA with A/B Updates* - "We can fix everything if this works"

==== Negotiable (Important but Flexible)

* 4 UARTs (important but not crucial)
* Protocol agnostic operation (debatable)
* Compliance auditability (debatable)

=== Solution Approach Overview

*Fundamental Architecture: Dual-Core Separation + Interrupts/DMA*

=== Technology Strategy

==== Core Technology Decisions

[options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
| Technology Area | Strategic Decision & Rationale

| *Architecture Pattern*
| Dual-core separation with interrupt/DMA - provides fault isolation while achieving hardware-driven performance

| *Programming Language*
| C with Native Pico SDK - leverages team expertise, provides full platform access, enables deterministic behavior

| *Memory Management*
| Static allocation only - enables industrial reliability through predictable behavior, no dynamic allocation risks

| *Inter-Core Communication*
| Cache-aligned ring buffers with mutexes - optimal performance with deterministic behavior

| *Ethernet Controller*
| ENC28J60 with software TCP/IP - "dumb" controller enables full code auditability and control
|===

==== Communication Architecture

*Ring Buffer Design:*

[source,c]
----
// Each entry = 1 cache line (64 bytes base + 1024 payload)
typedef struct {
    // Management Data (16 bytes)
    uint8_t  uart_channel;     // 0-3
    uint8_t  direction;        // TX/RX  
    uint8_t  status;           // FILLING/DRAINING/FULL/EMPTY
    uint8_t  payload_length;   // Actual data length
    uint32_t timestamp;        // Fill timestamp
    uint32_t sequence_id;      // For ordering/debugging
    uint32_t reserved;         // Future use/alignment
    
    // Payload Data (1024 bytes max)
    uint8_t  payload[1024];    // Fixed max size for worst case
} ring_entry_t;
----

*Memory Allocation Strategy:*

* Buffer Size: `(total_mem - static_vars) / sizeof(ring_entry_t) - 1` entries
* Cache Aligned: No core contention, optimal performance
* Overflow Policy: Drop oldest packets (deterministic, simple)

=== Decomposition Strategy

==== System Decomposition Approach

*Dual-core functional separation* - Each core specializes in distinct responsibilities with clean interfaces through shared memory ring buffers.

==== Major Components/Services

[options="header",cols="25,35,40"]
|===
| Component/Service | Responsibilities | Key Interfaces

| *Core 0 UART Manager*
| All 4 UART interfaces, interrupt/DMA handling, stream-to-packet conversion
| Hardware UARTs, Ring buffer producer

| *Core 1 Network Manager*
| TCP/IP stack, ENC28J60 control, packet-to-network conversion
| Ring buffer consumer, SPI to ENC28J60

| *Ring Buffer System*
| Inter-core communication, cache-aligned data transfer
| Shared memory + mutex interfaces

| *HTTP Management UI*
| Device configuration, diagnostics, OTA trigger
| HTTP server on Core 1

| *OTA Update System*
| Secure firmware updates, A/B partition management
| Secure boot, flash management
|===

==== Component Interaction Strategy

[plantuml, component-interaction, svg]
----
!include <C4/C4_Component>

title Component Interaction Strategy

Component(core0_uart, "Core 0\nUART Manager", "C/Interrupt", "4 UARTs → Packets")
Component(ring_buffer, "Ring Buffer\nSystem", "Shared Memory", "Cache-aligned transfer")
Component(core1_net, "Core 1\nNetwork Manager", "C/lwIP", "Packets → TCP")
Component(core1_http, "Core 1\nHTTP UI", "C/HTTP", "Management interface")
Component(core1_ota, "Core 1\nOTA Manager", "C/Secure", "Firmware updates")

Rel(core0_uart, ring_buffer, "produces", "Cache-aligned writes")
Rel(ring_buffer, core1_net, "consumes", "TCP transmission")
Rel(core1_http, core1_net, "shares Core 1", "Lower priority")
Rel(core1_ota, core1_net, "shares Core 1", "Secure updates")

note right of ring_buffer : Drop-oldest overflow\nDeterministic behavior
note right of core1_net : Priority: UART bridges > HTTP UI
----

*Interaction Principles:*

* Core 0 → Ring Buffer: UART streams converted to fixed-size packets, cache-aligned writes
* Ring Buffer → Core 1: Packet consumption for TCP transmission
* Overflow Policy: Drop oldest packets (deterministic, simple)
* Priority: UART processing takes priority over HTTP UI

=== Quality Achievement Strategy

==== Quality Goal Implementation

[options="header",cols="20,40,40"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Architectural Mechanisms | Validation Approach

| *Reliability*
| Core separation, static allocation, deterministic behavior, drop-oldest overflow
| Extended operation testing, fault injection, environmental testing

| *Compatibility*
| Protocol-agnostic packet handling, configurable UART parameters
| Testing with diverse industrial protocols, auto-negotiation validation

| *Performance*
| Interrupt/DMA driven I/O, cache-aligned buffers, hardware-optimized data paths
| Sustained 500kBaud testing, latency measurements, stress testing
|===

==== Cross-Cutting Concerns Strategy

[options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
| Cross-Cutting Concern | Implementation Strategy

| *Error Handling*
| Graceful degradation, fault isolation between cores, deterministic error responses

| *Memory Management*
| Static allocation only, pre-calculated buffer sizes, cache-aligned data structures

| *Security*
| Secure OTA updates, A/B partitioning, auditable code paths

| *Testing*
| Host-based testing with abstracted semaphores, hardware-in-the-loop validation
|===

=== Strategic Decisions and Trade-offs

==== Major Architectural Decisions

[options="header",cols="30,35,35"]
|===
| Decision | Rationale | Trade-offs

| *Dual-Core Separation*
| Fault isolation + performance, leverages RP2350 capabilities
| Increased complexity vs single-core simplicity

| *Fixed 1024-byte Packets*
| Deterministic behavior, handles worst-case scenarios
| 96% memory waste (avg 40 bytes vs 1024 max) accepted for simplicity

| *Drop-Oldest Overflow*
| Deterministic, reliable behavior under overload
| Data loss vs flow control complexity

| *Cache-Aligned Buffers*
| Optimal inter-core performance
| Memory overhead vs efficiency
|===

==== Key Trade-off: Fixed Packet Size Inefficiency

*The Challenge:*

* Realistic scenario: Max=1024 bytes, Average=40 bytes → 96% memory waste
* Risk: Significant resource inefficiency in typical use cases

*Mitigation Rationale:*

* Sub-5ms latency requirement limits buffering depth anyway (~2-3 packets maximum)
* Total waste limited: 4 UARTs × 3 packets × 1024 bytes = ~12KB (acceptable in 520KB system)
* Implementation simplicity enables reliable delivery

*Future Optimization Path:*

Protocol-aware multi-pool approach documented for later enhancement:

* Small Pool: 64-byte entries (for ≤40 byte packets)
* Medium Pool: 256-byte entries (for 41-200 byte packets)  
* Large Pool: 1024-byte entries (for 201-1024 byte packets)

==== Alternative Approaches Considered

[options="header",cols="25,50,25"]
|===
| Alternative | Why Not Selected | Key Insight

| *Single-Core Design*
| Cannot achieve 4-UART + network performance simultaneously
| Core separation essential for real-time requirements

| *Dynamic Memory Allocation*
| Conflicts with industrial reliability requirements
| Static allocation mandatory for predictable behavior

| *W5500 Ethernet Controller*
| Hardware TCP/IP stack not auditable, conflicts with compliance goals
| "Dumb" controller enables full code control
|===

=== Implementation Strategy

==== Development Approach

[options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
| Implementation Aspect | Strategy

| *Development Methodology*
| Test-driven development with host-based testing using abstracted semaphores

| *Testing Strategy*
| Host simulation with pthread/threads, then hardware validation

| *Risk Mitigation*
| Single UART + single TCP proof-of-concept first

| *Platform Abstraction*
| Abstract semaphores/mutexes for host testing: `platform_mutex_t`, `platform_semaphore_t`
