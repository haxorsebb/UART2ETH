=== Requirements Overview

==== Purpose
UART2ETH provides a hardware and firmware solution for bridging UART interfaces to TCP sockets, enabling network connectivity for legacy industrial equipment and embedded systems.

==== Core Functional Requirements

*Hardware Capabilities:*
* Support up to 4 independent UART interfaces
* 100Mbit network interface with RJ45 connector

*Networking Features:*
* Each UART exposed as individual TCP socket on dedicated port
* Raw TCP socket communication for transparent data transmission
* Support for concurrent connections (1 TCP connection per UART)

*Operating Modes:*
* Full Bridge Mode: Transparent UART-over-TCP for remote device connections
* Gateway Mode: Add networking capabilities to existing products without firmware modifications

*Firmware Management:*
* Secure Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates
* A/B update mechanism for rollback capability

*Protocol Optimization:*
* Custom pluggable serial protocol filters for efficient TCP packaging
* Configurable packet caching with ring buffer implementation
* Adjustable transmit timeouts for latency or bulk transfer optimization

==== Target Use Cases

==== Driving Forces

*Regulatory Compliance:*
* Western-only component supply chain for regulatory compliance
* Anticipation of new regulations requiring updateable and auditable firmware
* CE certification requirement for hardware

*Market Requirements:*
* Address gap left by discontinued commercial UART-to-TCP solutions
* Provide open source alternative to expensive or black-box commercial products
* Enable cost-effective networking solutions for system integrators
* Substantial per-unit cost savings when deploying multiple units in-house compared to commercial alternatives

*Technical Requirements:*
* 500kBaud sustained throughput capability
* Sub-5ms latency for real-time applications
* Critical system uptime within environmental specifications

=== Quality Goals

The following quality goals are prioritized by importance to our major stakeholders (industrial engineers and system integrators):

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Priority|Quality Goal|Concrete Scenario
|1|*Reliability* +
Critical system uptime for industrial applications
|A UART2ETH device deployed in a manufacturing line must maintain continuous operation for the duration that the connected hardware operates within environmental specifications. System failure should not occur due to software issues during normal operation.

|2|*Performance* +
Real-time data transmission capabilities  
|The system must sustain 500kBaud throughput with less than 5ms latency end-to-end. A PLC sending time-critical control data to a SCADA system must not experience delays that could affect industrial process control.

|3|*Compatibility* +
Seamless integration with diverse industrial systems
|The device must work transparently with various PLCs, SCADA systems, measurement instruments, and legacy equipment without requiring custom drivers or protocol modifications. A technician connecting an existing Siemens PLC to a Wonderware SCADA system should achieve immediate data flow without configuration conflicts.

|4|*Usability* +
Simple deployment without specialized knowledge
|A system integrator with basic understanding of serial communication and TCP/IP should be able to deploy and configure the device without extensive training. Configuration should be straightforward with clear error messages for common misconfigurations.

|5|*Maintainability* +
Secure field updates without physical access
|Firmware updates must be deployable remotely via OTA mechanism with A/B rollback capability. A device installed in a remote location must be updatable without requiring on-site technician visits, while ensuring update integrity and system recovery from failed updates.
