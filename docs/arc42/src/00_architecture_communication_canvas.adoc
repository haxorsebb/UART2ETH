a| 
*Value Proposition* +

Provide a low-cost, open source, western-component based, regulatory-compliant alternative to expensive or black-box UART-to-TCP bridge solutions for adding networking capabilities to legacy equipment.

.2+a| *Core Functions* +

* Full Bridge mode: Transparent UART over TCP for distant device connections
* Gateway mode: Add networking capabilities to products without development  
* Up to 4 UARTs exposed as TCP sockets on individual ports
* Secure OTA firmware updates with A/B update mechanism
* Custom pluggable serial protocol filters for efficient TCP packaging
* Package caching with custom transmit timeouts for latency/bulk optimization

.3+a| *Core Decisions - Good or Bad* +

Good:

* RP2350 selection for open ecosystem, long-term support, and secure update capabilities
* Moving from ATMega328 due to baudrate inflexibility and security limitations
* Western-only component supply chain for regulatory compliance

Bad:

* No major problematic decisions identified yet

Strategic:

* Anticipating new regulations requiring updateable and auditable firmware
* Addressing gap left by discontinued commercial solutions

.3+a| *Technologies* +

* Programming: C/C++ with Arduino framework
* Development: VSCodium IDE, PlatformIO build system
* Hardware: RP2350 microcontroller, ENC28J60 SPI Ethernet controller
* Protocols: Raw TCP sockets, HTTP for WebUI
* Security: RP2350 Boot ROM provided security mechanisms
* Infrastructure: GitHub runners for CI/CD
* Documentation: docToolchain with AsciiDoc

.2+a| *Key Stakeholder* +

* Industrial engineers dealing with infrastructure challenges (noise, cable length issues) requiring networking solutions for existing equipment
* System integrators needing regulatory-compliant, ready-to-use networking solutions for their products without custom development

a| *Quality Requirements* +

* Performance: 500kBaud sustained throughput, <5ms latency
* Reliability: Critical uptime as long as hardware operates within environmental specifications
* Security: Prevention of data distortion and lateral network movement attacks
* Usability: Users need basic understanding of serial communication and TCP/IP
* Scalability: 1 TCP connection per UART port
* Compliance: CE certification for hardware

2+a| *Business Context* +

* Data Sources: Legacy PLCs, sensors, measurement instruments, and older industrial equipment with serial interfaces but no networking capabilities
* Data Sinks: SCADA systems, custom data processing software, other UART2ETH devices (in Full Bridge mode)
* Network Environment: Industrial and household LANs operating at 100Mbit
* Dependencies: Only requires correctly routed network infrastructure
* No risky external interfaces or operational costs

2+a| *Components / Modules* +

Hardware Components:
* RP2350 microcontroller
* Microchip ENC28J60 SPI Ethernet Controller  
* RJ45 connector with integrated magnetics
* Crystal clock source
* SPI EEPROM for firmware storage

Software Modules:
* TCP/IP communication module
* UART instance modules (up to 4)
* OTA update manager with A/B update support
* Protocol filtering/packet splitting engine
* Caching module with flexible ring buffer
* Configuration management module
* Optional WebUI module
* PIO-based UART implementation (send/receive tasks on GPIO)

2+a| *Core Risks* +

* Primary security risk: Device compromise allowing data distortion or use as attack vector for lateral network movement
* Hardware component availability and supply chain disruptions
* Regulatory changes requiring additional compliance measures
* Performance degradation under high concurrent load scenarios

2+a| *Missing Information* +

* Testing framework selection not yet decided
* Specific cryptographic implementation details for OTA security
* WebUI design and user experience specifications
* Detailed protocol filter plugin architecture
* Performance benchmarking under various network conditions
* Industrial certification requirements beyond CE marking
