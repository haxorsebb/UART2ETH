== Architecture Constraints

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|Constraint|Description|Rationale

|*Hardware Platform*
|Must use RP2350 microcontroller as primary processing unit
|Provides required security features for OTA updates, sufficient processing power for 4 UART channels, and western supply chain compliance

|*Component Sourcing*
|All components must be sourced from western suppliers only
|Regulatory compliance requirement for target markets and supply chain security considerations

|*Performance Requirements*
|Minimum 500kBaud sustained throughput with sub-5ms latency per UART channel
|Industrial application requirements for real-time data transmission

|*Network Interface*
|100Mbit Ethernet connectivity via SPI-based controller
|Cost constraints and sufficient bandwidth for target applications while maintaining hardware simplicity

|*UART Channel Limit*
|Maximum 4 independent UART interfaces
|Hardware resource limitations of chosen microcontroller platform and cost optimization
|===

=== Organizational Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|Constraint|Description|Rationale

|*Open Source License*
|Complete system must be released under GPL license
|Leverage existing open source libraries and reduce implementation effort by reusing proven components

|*Development Process*
|Test-driven development (TDD) approach mandatory for all production code
|Quality assurance and maintainability requirements for industrial application reliability

|*Documentation Standard*
|Architecture documentation must follow arc42 template structure
|Standardized documentation approach for future maintainers and contributors

|*Version Control*
|GitHub-based development workflow with mandatory pull request reviews
|Code quality control and collaborative development coordination
|===

=== Economic Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|Constraint|Description|Rationale

|*Hardware Cost*
|Hardware target price per unit must be significantly below commercially available solutions
|Competitive market positioning requires substantial cost advantage to justify adoption over established commercial products

|*Development Effort*
|Development effort must achieve return on investment within first year of deployment
|Resource allocation constraint limits project scope and complexity to ensure economic viability and timely market entry
|===

=== Regulatory and Legal Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|Constraint|Description|Rationale

|*CE Certification*
|Hardware must achieve CE compliance for European market
|Legal requirement for commercial deployment in target markets

|*Firmware Security*
|Must implement secure boot and signed firmware update mechanisms
|Anticipated regulatory requirements for updateable industrial devices

|*EMC Compliance*
|Electromagnetic compatibility requirements for industrial environments
|Regulatory requirement and operational necessity in electrically noisy industrial settings

|*Export Control*
|No components or technologies subject to export restrictions
|Unrestricted distribution and deployment capability

|*Patent Avoidance*
|Must not infringe on existing patents in communication protocols or hardware interfaces
|Legal risk mitigation and freedom to operate requirements
