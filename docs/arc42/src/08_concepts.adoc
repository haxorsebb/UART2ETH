== Cross-cutting Concepts

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Protocol Filtering

Protocol filtering provides a configurable mechanism to determine packet boundaries in UART data streams. The system implements pluggable filters that analyze incoming byte streams to identify complete data units for efficient TCP transmission.

==== Packet Determination Algorithm

The protocol filter operates on incoming UART data to identify discrete packets using configurable delimiters and patterns:

.Basic Line-Based Filter Example
[source]
----
Input stream:  "sensor1=23.5\r\ntemperature=18.2\r\nhumidity=65\r\n"
Delimiter:     "\r\n"
Output packets: 
  - "sensor1=23.5"
  - "temperature=18.2" 
  - "humidity=65"
----

==== Filter Types

The system supports multiple filter implementations:

* **Line-based filters**: Use configurable line terminators (\r\n, \n, \r)
* **Fixed-length filters**: Extract packets of predetermined byte count
* **Delimiter-based filters**: Use custom byte sequences as packet boundaries
* **Timeout-based filters**: Form packets after configurable idle periods

==== Configuration Parameters

Each UART channel supports independent filter configuration:

* Filter type selection
* Delimiter specification (for delimiter-based filters)
* Packet length (for fixed-length filters)
* Timeout values (for timeout-based filters)
* Maximum packet size limits

=== Web Management Interface

The web management interface provides system configuration and monitoring through three main functional areas.
